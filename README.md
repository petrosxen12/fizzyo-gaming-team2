Concept:

An endless runner type of game where the user is a spaceship travelling through space trying to avoid asteroids and collect as much coins as possible. By doing good breaths the player earns more points and also gains more power-ups to advance through the game.

Player is a spaceship that travels through a galaxy full of asteroids and occasionally can encountered larger objects such as planets. 

  Two Game Objectives:
    -Survive by avoiding asteroids as long as possible.
    -Collect as much tokens/coins as you can.

The ship is in a binary state of moving left or right.
    Device button changes the direction of motion. 
Score is obtained at a steady rate for each unit distance moved.
  Double or triple the score for consecutive good breaths similar to a combo-breaker. 
User receives power-ups upon consecutive good breaths such as the ability to pass through asteroids or more lives.
Bad breaths deduct points from user.
Add different levels/galaxies that can be unlocked upon reaching a certain score (i.e unlock one level at 1000 and another at 2500 points).
